## Task 1: Introduction

pyramid of pain
: a pyramid that demonstrates that some IOCs (indicators of compromise) are
  more troubling to adversaries than others. This is because when those
  indicators are denied to an attacker, the loss of some will be more painful
  to them than the loss of others.<sup>[[1]][pop]</sup>

The [Pyramid of Pain][pop] concept is applied to cybersecurity solutions such as:

* [Cisco Security](https://gblogs.cisco.com/ca/2020/08/26/the-canadian-bacon-cisco-security-and-the-pyramid-of-pain/)
* [SentinelOne](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/revisiting-the-pyramid-of-pain-leveraging-edr-data-to-improve-cyber-threat-intelligence/)
* [SOCRadar](https://socradar.io/re-examining-the-pyramid-of-pain-to-use-cyber-threat-intelligence-more-effectively/)

![Pyramid of Pain](./pics/pyramidofpain.jpg)

CTI (Cyber Threat Intelligence)
: is an evidence-based knowledge about adversaries, including their indicators,
  tactics, motivations, and actionable advice against them.

## Task 2: Hash Values (Trivial) - Blue

> It's easy to spot a malicious file if we have the hash in our arsenal.
>> :warning: Modifying files by even a single bit will produce a different hash
             value.

MD5 (Message Digest)
: a hash function that outputs 128-bit hash value. :x:*(Unsecure as of 2011)*

SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1)
: a hash function that outputs an 160-bit hash value/40-digit hex.
  :x:*(Unsecure as of 2013)*

SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2)
: a hash function that outputs varied-bit hash values. Most common is
  **SHA-256** which returns a 256-bit hash value/64-digit hex.

collision
: when two different files have the same hash value or digest.

Cybersecurity News Websites with Ransomware Reports:

* [The DFIR Report](https://thedfirreport.com/)
* [FireEye Threat Research Blogs](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research.html)

Online File-Hash Lookup Websites:

* [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/)
* [Metadefender Cloud - OPSWAT](https://metadefender.opswat.com/?lang=en)

### Code: Change a File's Hash in PowerShell (Windows)

``` powershell
# Get the file hash in PowerShell on a Windows computer
Get-FileHash .\filename-01.msi - Algorithm MD5

# Append some rando shit
echo "AppendTheHash" >> .\filename-01.msi

# Get the modified file's new hash value
Get-FileHash .\filename-01.msi - Algorithm MD5
```

### Walkthrough: Task 2

#### Question 1

Analyse the report associated with the hash
"b8ef959a9176aef07fdca8705254a163b50b49a17217a4ff0107487f59d4a35d"
[here](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/pyramidofpain/t3-virustotal.pdf).
What is the filename of the sample?

## Task 3: IP Addresses (Easy) - Dark Green

A **common defense tactic** is to block, drop, or deny inbound requests from IP
addresses on your parameter or external firewall. This tactic is often not
bulletproof as itâ€™s trivial for an experienced adversary to recover simply by
using a new public IP address.

Fast Flux
: a DNS technique used by botnets to hide phishing, web proxying, malware
  delivery, and malware communication activities behind compromised hosts
  acting as proxies.  The **purpose** of using the Fast Flux network is to make
  the communication between malware and its C2 server challenging to be
  discovered by security professionals.<sup>[[2]][akamai]</sup>

***A Fast Flux network is having multiple IP address associated with a domain
name, which is constantly changing.***

## Task 4: Domain Names (Simple) - Light Green

> :warning: Many DNS providers have loose standards and provide APIs to make it
            even easier for the attacker to change the domain.

### Punycode Attack

> Punycode Defense: use proxy logs or web server logs to detect mailicious
                    domains.

Punycode attack
: a way of converting words that cannot be written in ASCII, into a Unicode
ASCII encoding.<sup>[[3]][punycode_def]</sup>

**Punycode Attack example redirects to `hxxp://xn--addad-o4a.de/`:**

![Punycode Attack example](./pics/pyramidofpain-punycode_atk_1.png)

**Original URL of `adidas.de`:**

![Original URL](./pics/pyramidofpain-punycode_atk_2.png)

### URL Shorteners

The following URL Shortening services can be used to generate malicious links:

* bit.ly
* goo.gl
* ow.ly
* s.id
* smarturl.it
* tiny.pl
* tinyurl.com
* x.co

:computer: Append a `+` to the end of the shortened URL to show the actual
           redirecting website. Ie *(not real URLs)*:

* hxxp://tinyur.com/cn6xznu+
* hxxp://bit.ly/vHle3Si+
